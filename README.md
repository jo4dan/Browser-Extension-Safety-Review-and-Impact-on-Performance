# Browser Extension Safety Review Report

## Introduction

This report documents the process and findings from a thorough review of the browser extensions installed on my system. The primary goal was to evaluate the safety of browser add-ons, identify unnecessary or potentially harmful extensions, and understand the risks associated with malicious browser extensions.

---

## Steps Followed

### 1. Accessing the Extension Manager

I started by opening the extension/add-ons manager through my browser’s settings menu. This section lists all installed extensions, both enabled and disabled.

### 2. Reviewing Installed Extensions

Each extension was reviewed individually. I paid close attention to unfamiliar names and those I didn’t recall installing myself. For every listed extension, I noted its developer, purpose, and frequency of use.

### 3. Checking Permissions and Reviews

For each extension, I:
- Checked the permissions it requested (such as access to browsing history, all websites, clipboard, etc.).
- Searched the browser’s extension store for user reviews and ratings.
- Looked for news or forum posts flagging any security issues.

Extensions requesting broad permissions or with poor user reviews were flagged for further scrutiny.

### 4. Identifying Unused or Suspicious Extensions

Unused extensions—those I hadn’t used in weeks or months—were identified. Extensions that showed suspicious behaviors (such as requesting excessive permissions or unfamiliar branding) were also noted.

### 5. Removing Unnecessary and Suspicious Extensions

All unused and flagged suspicious extensions were removed from the browser using the extension manager’s built-in “Remove” function. Only regularly used and well-reviewed extensions remained.

### 6. Restarting and Assessing Browser Performance

After removals, I restarted the browser. 
- Page load times and tab switching felt noticeably faster.
- The browser startup sequence completed more quickly.
- Memory usage was slightly reduced based on the browser’s resource monitor.

### 7. Researching Risks of Malicious Extensions

I researched online to understand how malicious browser extensions operate. Findings include:
- Some extensions inject ads, track browsing activity, or harvest personal information without user consent.
- Malicious add-ons may redirect search queries, steal login credentials, or install further malware.
- Even extensions with many downloads can be compromised if attackers buy and modify them or exploit updates.

Trusted sources like browser documentation, reputable tech news outlets, and forums emphasize the importance of reviewing permissions and keeping extensions to a minimum.

### 8. Documentation of Actions Taken

**Extensions Removed:**
- [Extension Name 1]: Unused, requested reading browsing history.
- [Extension Name 2]: Negative reviews mentioning adware behavior.
- [Extension Name 3]: No longer needed for coursework.

**Extensions Retained:**
- Extensions with high ratings, transparent permissions, and regular updates.
- Only those strictly needed for academic work or productivity.

**Evidence of Improvement:**
- Faster browser performance.
- Increased confidence in browsing security.
- Fewer distractions from unwanted toolbar buttons or notifications.

## Conclusion

The review and removal of extensions led to a more secure and responsive browser experience. Research confirmed that malicious extensions can exploit user data or browser functionality, validating the importance of regular add-on audits. The process highlighted the value of:
- Limiting extensions to trusted, necessary ones.
- Reviewing permissions and user feedback.
- Removing anything unfamiliar or unused.

I recommend repeating this review regularly and staying updated on extension-related security news to maintain a safe browsing environment.
